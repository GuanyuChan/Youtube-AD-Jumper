Introducing the YouTube ad blocker! This tool automatically clicks the "skip ad" button without any action required from the user. However, please note that some ads may not be skipped due to changes in the YouTube ad style. In such cases, please open an issue and report it to me. Your cooperation will be greatly appreciated.

The YouTube ad blocker is built using JavaScript as its main programming language. Please note that copying the tool is strictly prohibited!

Please note that the blocker is still undergoing repairs and may contain bugs. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

To use the tool, you will need to install the Tampermonkey extension, which is available on both the Edge extension store and the Chrome web store.
